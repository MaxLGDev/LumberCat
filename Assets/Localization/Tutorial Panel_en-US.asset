      There are 5 rounds in total. Each round will have a random mechanic. It means
      that every new game will have a different order of mechanics.


      - To
      win a round, you need to completely fill the progress bar at the bottom.


      -
      Have fun and try to have the best possible score!'

      - You only have to focus at around 50%. Otherwise,
      just go wild on the key.


      - Going under 45% will go back to the first
      key. Be careful!'

      - Slowly but surely is the good
      strategy for this one, as spamming too much can make you lose a lot of progress.


      -
      Be careful of the key you''re pressing! The change can be very fast!'

      - Keep an eye on the next key to
      prepare yourself. Focusing on the green key in this case could be fatal.


      -
      Take this one slowly! It''s all about managing the current key while thinking
      about the next.'

      green one. Alternate between the two keys until you fill the bar.


      -
      Keep the rhythm in mind. If you lose it, you could lose a lot of progress until
      you find back the correct rhythm.


      - Don''t try to go too fast! A good
      alternating rhythm is more important.'
